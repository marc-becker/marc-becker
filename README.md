## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a service researcher investigating how AI agents and especially Service Robots should behave and what they should look and feel like. Crucial questions of my research include how service robots and AI impact customers and their service experience, how they can best collaborate and team up with service employees, and how their emergence prompt changes in business models and organisational structures. Here, I take particular interest in understanding the importance of Service Robots possessing emotional communication capabilities.

I am currently a PhD Candidate at the School of Business and Economics at Maastricht University, The Netherlands. In this role, I am primarily conducting research but also teach Bachelor and Master courses, such as Service Management, Marketing Management, and Management Information Systems. In addition, I supervise Master theses.

In case you have any questions or would like to collaborate, please feel free to reach out.

My intersts include:
- Service Robots
- Generative AI
- ChatGPT, Gemini, Llama, Claude
- Digital and technology-enabled services
